One concern is that it will be difficult to find enough open-source
projects to handle the steady stream of students that would be delivered
by a successful ongoing MOOC course. Each such project would need to be:

* interesting to students
* technically approachable by students
* include stakeholders or mentors motivated to review student work

This page is a canvas to brainstorm ideas of how to find or create
scalable OSS projects for the course.

One idea would be to widen the scope of the course. Students would be
required not only to join projects, but also to create and lead projects.
Perhaps the course could offer multiple tracks or additional credit for
project owners.

The most succesful of these new projects would live on beyond the class
and will become interesting on their own merit. Ideally, the project
owners will be receptive to work done by students in future terms of the
MOOC course.

Ideally one would have contacts with a range of non-profit and charity organizations
that need techincal support.  The first 169.1 MOOC class project [LocalSupport](http://harrowcn.org.uk)
is actually a framework for networking non-profit and charity organizations.  It
would be expedient to be encouraging LocalSupport setups in student locales and 
reaching out to the network of charities and non-profits to see if they have
technical needs that could be addressed with open source projects.

This is at least partly what the Berkeley face to face class includes, whereby 
the Berkeley professors reach out to Bay area charities and pre-select 50 or so
that can work with students on agile projects.

Clearly the framework should adapt to the needs of the MOOC students.  Non-profit and
charity work is to be encouraged, but if students want to work on their own or existing
projects that should be encouraged.  As long as they are open source then grading metrics 
can be applied and credit assigned.

Any other ideas ...?
