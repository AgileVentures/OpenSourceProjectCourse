I'm concerned that it will be difficult to find enough open-source
projects to handle the steady stream of students that would be delivered
by a successful ongoing MOOC course. Each such project would need to be:

* interesting to students
* technically approachable by students
* include stakeholders or mentors motivated to review student work

This page is a canvas to brainstorm ideas of how to find or create
scalable OSS projects for the course.

One idea would be to widen the scope of the course. Students would be
required not only to join projects, but also to create and lead projects.
Perhaps the course could offer multiple tracks or additional credit for
project owners.

The most succesful of these new projects would live on beyond the class
and will become interesting on their own merit. Ideally, the project
owners will be receptive to work done by students in future terms of the
MOOC course.

... what else ...
