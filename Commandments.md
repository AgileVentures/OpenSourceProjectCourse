3rd Commandment:
Never ask on IM if someone is there or not, instead thou must always ask your question in as much detail 
as possible and see who responds!

4th Commandment:
Whenever emailing or IMing something about almost anything thou must include a precise hyperlink to the 
topic in question, e.g. https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/58807822

5th Commandment:
When asking a question, please ensure to provide sufficient information that allows someone to answer the question, 
example of a bad question: "how can i use ruby to make a simple template?".  Critical information that should have 
been provided: what kind of template? and for what purpose?

6th Commandment: 
Ensure that questions are asked in the correct forum.  In general prefer the forum with the widest readership, e.g.
StackOverflow, group mailing list, group IM. By asking an individual directly you prevent the wider group potentially 
benefiting from the seeing both question and answer
