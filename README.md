OpenSourceProjectCourse
=======================

Description of a course where credit is given for contributions to Open Source Non-Profit Projects

Basic idea is a MOOC where students would get credit for contributions to a set of pre-specified open source projects that
support non-profit clients.  Students would need to follow BDD/TDD practices, forking the existing projects and working
on tasks co-ordinated by Pivotal Tracker or similar.  Credit would be given when student contributions via pull request
were green and accepted into the main codebased by the repository maintainers.


Challenges

* Collecting enough non-profit clients
* High drop out rate in the MOOC
