OpenSourceProjectCourse
=======================

Description of a course where credit is given for contributions to Open Source Non-Profit Projects

Overall Course Goal
------------------

To be able to effectively contribute to large OSS projects.

Summary
------------------

The basic idea is a MOOC where students would get credit for contributions
to a set of pre-specified open source projects that support non-profit
clients.  Students would need to follow BDD/TDD practices, forking the
existing projects and working on tasks co-ordinated by Pivotal Tracker or
similar.  Credit would be given when student contributions via pull
request were green and accepted into the main codebase by the repository
maintainers.



Sub Goals
------------------
* learn how to effectively find and use existing projects.
* reasoning about large systems.
* learning how to find tools and libraries
* working with particular tool chains.


Challenges
------------------

* Collecting enough non-profit clients
* High drop out rate in the MOOC
* Teach in a language/platform independent way? Or limit to projects in a
  particular language?  Ditto for tool-chains; how to teach BDD/TDD
  without "locking in" too many tools.
   -- makes sense to initially limit language
* How to keep course from getting progressively harder? (As students pick
  off easy projects, it becomes increasingly difficult to find new
  projects).
   -- course will need constant inflow of OS projects
* How to avoid competition for tasks? (With a typical MOOC student base of
  thousands of students, many will gravitate to the same tasks. But, only
  one copy of code for a particular task can be accepted into a project).
   -- could give credit simply for pull request, or ensure an ever increasing number of projects
