OpenSourceProjectCourse
=======================

Description of a course where credit is given for contributions to Open Source Non-Profit Projects

Overall Course Goal
------------------

To be able to effectively contribute to large OSS projects.

Summary
------------------

The basic idea is a MOOC where students would get credit for contributions
to a set of pre-specified open source projects that support non-profit
clients.  Students would need to follow BDD/TDD practices, forking the
existing projects and working on tasks co-ordinated by Pivotal Tracker or
similar.  Credit would be given when student contributions via pull
request were green and accepted into the main codebase by the repository
maintainers.



Sub Goals
------------------
* learn how to effectively find and use existing projects.
* reasoning about large systems.
* learning how to find tools and libraries
* working with particular tool chains.


Challenges
------------------

* Collecting enough non-profit clients
* High drop out rate in the MOOC
* Teach in a language/platform independent way? Or limit to projects in a
  particular language?  Ditto for tool-chains; how to teach BDD/TDD
  without "locking in" too many tools.
   -- makes sense to initially limit language
* How to keep course from getting progressively harder? (As students pick
  off easy projects, it becomes increasingly difficult to find new
  projects).
   -- course will need constant inflow of OS projects
* How to avoid competition for tasks? (With a typical MOOC student base of
  thousands of students, many will gravitate to the same tasks. But, only
  one copy of code for a particular task can be accepted into a project).
   -- could give credit simply for pull request, or ensure an ever
   increasing number of projects

Motivation

* Nice quote by [Paul Stacey](http://mooc.efquel.org/week-9-the-pedagogy-of-moocs-by-paul-stacey/)

> Let me end with my own pedagogical recommendations for MOOC’s:
>
> * Be as open as possible. Go beyond open enrollments and use open
>   pedagogies that leverage the entire web not just the specific content in
>   the MOOC platform. As part of your open pedagogy strategy use OER and
>   openly license your resources using Creative Commons licenses in a way
>   that allows reuse, revision, remix, and redistribution. Make your MOOC
>   platform open source software. Publish the learning analytics data you
>   collect as open data using a CC0 license.      
>
> * Use tried and proven modern online learning pedagogies not campus
>   classroom-based didactic learning pedagogies which we know are ill-suited
>   to online learning.  
>
> * Use peer-to-peer pedagogies over self study. We know this improves
>   learning outcomes. The cost of enabling a network of peers is the same as
>   that of networking content – essentially zero.  
>
> * Use social learning including blogs, chat, discussion forums, wikis,
>   and group assignments. 
> * Leverage massive participation – have all students contribute
>   something that adds to or improves the course overall.
