OpenSourceProjectCourse
=======================

Description of a course where credit is given for contributions to Open Source Non-Profit Projects

Overall Course Goal
------------------
To be able to effectively contribute quality code to large projects

Summary
------------------

Basic idea is a MOOC where students would get credit for contributions to a set of pre-specified open source projects that
support non-profit clients.  Students would need to follow BDD/TDD practices, forking the existing projects and working
on tasks co-ordinated by Pivotal Tracker or similar.  Credit would be given when student contributions via pull request
were green and accepted into the main codebased by the repository maintainers.

Sub Goals
------------------
* learn how to effectively find and use existing projects.
* reasoning about large systems.
* learning how to find tools and libraries
* working with particular tool chains.


Challenges
------------------

* Collecting enough non-profit clients
* High drop out rate in the MOOC
