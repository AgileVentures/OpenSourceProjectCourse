Writing Cucumber Scenarios

[autograded - could provide a series of steps ... hmm, still need peer review to assess quality of scenarios ...]

If we had a collection of existing steps we could use those and run the cucumber against a html site in dropbox or similar???

problem is that to run cucumber we need the command line, although we could use an autograder to allow student to submit
cucumber scenarios and have them assessed ...
