Writing Cucumber Scenarios

[autograded - could provide a series of steps ... hmm, still need peer review to assess quality of scenarios ...]

If we had a collection of existing steps we could use those and run the cucumber against a html site in
dropbox or similar???

problem is that to run cucumber we need the command line, although we could use an
autograder to allow student to submit cucumber scenarios and have them assessed ...

Biggest problem may be understanding the error messages?  Not so hard in ruby mine?

Start with a code version that all just works? an autograder that accepts complete stories and hits web pages of
your choice?

at least I feel like the place to start learning about code is in step files ... at least the very first project
should involve user stories and web page ...
