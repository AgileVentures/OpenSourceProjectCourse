Possible Sequence

1. Talking to clients - its all about communication
2. Activity diagrams
3. User stories and wireframes
4. Cucumber Features - store through web interface to Github
5. Step definitions and Regexp
6. HTML mockups tested with Cucumber

HTML mockups also on github, but now we need command line etc to actually run the cucumber scenarios? Or do we ...?

Can we deploy to heroku from web interface? Need quick and dirty testing environment for cucumber, ideally onlinee - can't find one - okay, so at this point we have to introduce the command line?
