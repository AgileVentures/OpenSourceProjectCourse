Possible Sequence

1. Talking to clients - its all about communication
2. Activity diagrams
3. User stories and wireframes
4. Cucumber Features - store through web interface to Github
5. Step definitions and Regexp
6. HTML mockups tested with Cucumber

HTML mockups also on github, but now we need command line etc to actually run the cucumber scenarios? Or do we ...?

Can we deploy to heroku from web interface? Need quick and dirty testing environment for cucumber, ideally online - can't find one - okay, so at this point we have to introduce the command line?  

Could be using github pages to deploy html site (or even dropbox?), then hitting that with cucumber ... cucumber could be run from rubymine ...

want to try and inculcate the levels of testing from the beginning - but could also be talking about hacking something together in terms of time to market, but then the difficulty of maintaining

[should this all go in jekyll?]

[maybe start off with a cucumber homework? or work through each of these segments one by one?]
[can I co-create this with somebody ... in real time ...?]
